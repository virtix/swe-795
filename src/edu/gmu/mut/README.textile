h1. Customer Loyalty Discount Coupon : A TDD Exercise 

This program will compute a discount to customers based on certain business rules; i.e., how much they have purchased in the past and how frequently. They more they have purchased, the higher the discount rate. These rules, can change at any time, of course.

Assume a customer with the following information: Name, email, date registered, last visit date, and a purchase history which contains item,date,price

Rules (all these apply to the total amount of the next purchase):
* If the user is brand new, that is, the account has been created less than 30 days ago and has not made a purchase, give that person a 15% discount.
* If the user's account is more than 30 days old, and they have not made any purchases, and they have visited the site in the last week, give them a 10% discount.
* If the user has purchased more than $1000 within the last year, give them a 20% discount.
* If the user has purchased more than $500 but less than $1000 within the last year, give them a 15% discount.
* If the user has purchased between $100 and $500 with the past year, give them a 10% discount.
* For all other existing users who have purchased anything within the last 2 years, give them a 5% discount.
